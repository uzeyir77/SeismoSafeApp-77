/*SeismoSafe isn't just another app; it's a lifeline in the face of one of nature's most unpredictable forces. Built on cutting-edge seismic data and advanced mapping technologies, SeismoSafe provides real-time information about earthquake occurrences, their magnitude, and affected areas. With just a few taps, users can access a comprehensive map interface displaying recent seismic activity, helping them stay informed and vigilant.
 
 However, SeismoSafe doesn't stop at mere observation. It empowers individuals and communities to take proactive measures to safeguard themselves against earthquakes. One of its standout features is the "Safe Zone Planner." This innovative tool utilizes sophisticated algorithms and geological data to identify and recommend safe zones within users' vicinity during an earthquake. By analyzing factors such as soil stability, proximity to fault lines, and building structures, SeismoSafe helps users make informed decisions about where to seek refuge in times of crisis.*/
